* ST_LSM6DSX driver for STM LSM6DS3-LSM6DSM 6-axis (acc + gyro) Mems sensor

Required properties:
- compatible: must be one of:
  "st,lsm6ds3"
  "st,lsm6dsm"
- reg: i2c address of the sensor / spi cs line

Optional properties:
- interrupts: interrupt mapping for GPIO IRQ
- interrupt-parent: should be the phandle for the interrupt controller

Example:

lsm6dsm@6b {
	compatible = "st,lsm6dsm";
	reg = <0x6b>;
	interrupt-parent = <&gpio0>;
	interrupts = <0 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>;
};
